# RootFind
Simple c++ program that will find the roots of two functions (defined in src/Fun1.cpp src/Fun2.cpp) using gradient descent method and Newton-Raphson method. New functions may be added and implemented following the templet provided by Fun1.cpp and Fun2.cpp. 
Note this programme will require the 'armadillo' linear algebra package to be installed (library is in /usr/lib on tested version)
